# Tools and documents

This page list the tools and documents used for collaborating.

## Tools

The tool stack is quite simple at the moment and composed of:
- a google drive with all the documents [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1db2hYZuRs2VjoIrVaVtZJ5FLE2iS7z3p?usp=sharing), and
- a forum for discussion.

Both these tools are viewable by everyone and editable by the OC/SC members.
